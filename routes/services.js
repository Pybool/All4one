    description: `The degenerative neurological condition known as Parkinson's disease is irreversible and untreatable. It is brought on by the progressive malfunction and death of brain cells.

        Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of many nerve cells, including those important for dopamine synthesis. Consequently, patients with Parkinson's disease are typically deficient in this chemical.
        
        Parkinson's disease is often characterized by tremors, stiffness, and a slowing of movement. The progression of the disease may differ from individual to individual, but these symptoms are relatively constant. It is possible for individuals to encounter difficulties with their ability to sleep, their memory, and their mental health as the disease develops.
        <br> <br>
        As a result of the fact that Parkinson's disease symptoms can vary significantly across individuals, we tailor our services to each customer we serve.
        
        We collaborate with them, their loved ones, and other healthcare professionals to develop a care plan that is individually customized to their requirements and complemented with pleasurable daily activities.
